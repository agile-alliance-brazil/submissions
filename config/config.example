 # SMTP settings are needed if you want to test sending e-mails from your development
 # environment. These settings are used to setup ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings, as
 # described in:

 #
 # :ses:
 #   :access_key_id: your_aws_access_key_id
 #   :secret_access_key: your_aws_secret_access_key
 #
 # To test in development mode with SES, you will also need to change
 # config/environments/development.rb and add the following:
 #
 # config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :ses

 # The application can be configured to track exceptionr/errors with airbrake, by
 # providing your Airbrake access key as follows:
 #
 # :airbrake:
 #   :access_key: xxx111xxx
