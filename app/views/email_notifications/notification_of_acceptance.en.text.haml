Dear #{@session.authors.map(&:full_name).join(" & ")},


We are pleased to inform you that your proposal '#{h(@session.title)}' has been selected to be part of the program of the Brazilian Conference about Agile Methods – #{@conference_name}!


We would like to ask you to confirm your attendance at the event by #{Ability::AUTHOR_CONFIRMATION_DEADLINE.strftime('%H:%M of %B %dth, %Y')} by accessing the form at

= session_confirm_url(@session, :locale => 'en')


If you can not attend the event, we kindly ask you to confirm your withdrawal using the form at

= session_withdraw_url(@session, :locale => 'en')


Only the first author of the session (#{@session.author.full_name}) can confirm or withdraw the attendance.


The author who does not confirm or withdraw their attendance until #{Ability::AUTHOR_CONFIRMATION_DEADLINE.strftime('%B %dth, %Y')} will have their proposal automatically removed from the program and replaced immediately by other selected work.


Once the attendance or withdraw has been confirmed for the event, you can refer to the comments and suggestions made by the evaluators accessing:

= session_reviews_url(@session, :locale => 'en')


ATTENTION: THE FIRST AUTHOR OF EACH SESSION IS ENTITLED FOR FREE CONFERENCE REGISTRATION!

Your registration will be processed by the organization of #{@conference_name} once your attendance is confirmed.


We will soon be sending more instructions to the speakers. Should you have any queries, requests or comments, please contact the Program Committee at programa@agilebrazil.com.


We hope to see you soon!
