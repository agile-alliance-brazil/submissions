      session:
        language: "What language are you going to present? Make sure your submission and your slides are written in that language."
        track_id: "Track is the first filter for participants to choose the sessions they want to see. Reviewers will check if your session fits the track and track leaders will have a number of slots per track to fill. Improve your chances of selection and success by putting your proposal on the <a href='%{year}/tracks?locale=en' target='_blank'>right track</a>."
        audience_level_id: "The audience level indicates the depth of the content of the session, specifically with respect to the topic proposed. This year we will have the following levels: Superficial (pre-requisites are optional), Intermediate (pre-requisites are important, but can be more generic), and Deep (pre-requisites are mandatory, and must be specific). If the session focuses on presenting concepts to the public, use \"Superficial\". If the expected audience is the one who already practices the topic and is already exploring it, choose \"Intermediate\"; And, if the intention is to go beyond the status quo or challenge the current understanding, level should be \"Deep\"! <a href='%{year}/audience_levels?locale=en' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Read more about them here</a>!"
        session_type_id: "Choose the <a href='%{year}/session_types?locale=en' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>session type</a> according to the experience you want to give your audience!"
        session_duration: "Most session types have a predetermined duration, but if you chose \"Presentation\", you will need to decide on the most appropriate duration for your content. We notice a public predilection for more concise and straightforward presentations, so remember to use the time you choose the best way you possibly can."
        audience_limit: "As you have chosen the 'Hands On' session type, we would like to know how many people can be part of your session. Also, for that kind of session, it might be interesting to add to your experience on the previous tries of this session and how many people attended."
        title: "The title of your session is the item with the highest visibility of your submission, both for reviewers and participants, it should be brief, clear, consistent with your talk and preferably thought-provoking. Be creative, but not so much to the point of losing the connection with reality or the subject of the talk."
        tag_list: "Attendees will use this information on the schedule app to find sessions that interests them most, orthogonally to tracks. Choose wisely up to %{count} tags in order to help your targeted audience find your session. A good match between right attendees and the right session turns into good feedback."
        no_limit_tag_list: "Attendees will use this information on the schedule app to find sessions that interests them most, orthogonally to tracks. Choose wisely up to your tags in order to help your targeted audience find your session. A good match between right attendees and the right session turns into good feedback."
        second_author_username: "The second author must be registered to submit proposals. During the submission period you can go back and edit / fill in this field. Reviewers will evaluate authors as equals, there are no preference or advantage for being 1st and 2nd speaker. We also remind you that \"25 minute presentations\" can be presented in pair, but only one receives a free registration. Being a 2nd author also counts towards your 3 proposals limit."
        target_audience: "Who are your target audience? Briefly describe who you believe your target audience should be, who else would be interested in what you have to say, for example: developers, analysts, architects, project managers, executives, etc. This field is used especially by reviewers to assess the consistency of its content."
        prerequisites: "What prior knowledge a person should have to participate and take advantage of this talk is used by reviewers to assess consistency between content, level and duration, and will be visible in the details of your session in the program schedule."
        summary: "The main importance of the abstract is to attract the audience to your presentation. After the title, participants can read your abstract to better what you intend to talk about. Reviewers evaluate the consistency of the abstract and then the full description (so there is no need for you to repeat such information)."
        description: "This field <b> is not visible to participants </b>, however, it is the main field for reviewers, it connects the other information and puts it in context, allowing us to evaluate the cohesion of the proposal. What you want to discuss, your perspective on the subject, etc. If you have slides, put the link. Add any information that shows us that your session is the right choice for our audience and please <b>do not repeat your summary</b>. "
        mechanics: "The mechanics field is only mandatory for Hands On sessions. You must tell us how you want to interact with the audience during your session, what techniques you want to use, how you want to segment your time, and the layout of the room. This field is not visible to participants either."
        benefits: "List the benefits to those who attend your session. What they will learn? What they will experience? What they will bring home? Make it clear why it is especially interesting for participants and be specific. Do not make up any arguments, this text is not visible to participants. Just be honest and highlight to reviewers what your session will bring to the conference. Do not be vague, too. Phrases like \"understand agile better\" do not bring enough detail to our assessment."
        experience: "We are not looking for any particular kind of credentials, but rather the motives you believe your circumstances, story, knowledge, past presentations, research fronts, or inspirations qualify you. This field is not about your resumé: we will assess your mini-bio separately! This field is about <b>this proposal, specifically</b>. Attendees won't see this information. And remember: if you have a 2nd author, mention both here."
