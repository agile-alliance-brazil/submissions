This will be used to evaluate your session.<br/>In this field, a limited markup syntax is allowed. See the <a href='/syntax_help?locale=en' target='_blank'>reference guide</a> for details."

        default_locale: "We will display the site and send you e-mails in your preferred language"
      session:
        language: "What language will you give your talk in? Make sure your submission is also written in that language and consider using it in your slides."
        track_id: "Track is the first filter for participants to choose the sessions they want to see. Reviewers will check if your session fits the track and track leaders will have a number of slots per track to fill. Improve your chances of selection and success by putting your proposal on the <a href='%{year}/tracks?locale=en' target='_blank'>right track</a>."
        audience_level_id: "The audience level generates expectations on the depth of the session's content. It is possible to have sessions of the same subject in any level, but the approach changes: we expect Novice level sessions to be introductory, while Proficient ones to skip basic concepts and focus on new perspectives, questionings and so. The new levels are based on the Dreyfus model and you should <a href='%{year}/audience_levels?locale=en' target='_blank'>learn more about them</a> first!"
        session_type_id: "This year the program is looking for more interactive and innovative sessions, so we created a whole new session type called \"Be Creative!\" (find out more <a href='/2016/session_types?locale=en' target='_blank'>here</a>). However, if you feel that a more traditional format is best suited for your session submit a 'presentation', that are two durations available 50' and 25'. Keep in mind that short sessions are a better fit to people's attention span, but, as an author, they require great synthesis and conciseness. Choose the right <a href='/2016/session_types?locale=en' target='_blank'>session_type</a> accordingly to the experience you want to provide!"
        session_duration: "Most session types have a pre-defined duration, but if you picked the types \"presentation\", you must decide on the appropriate duration for your content. We notice from previous conferences' feedback people prefer concise and to the point sessions, so remember you should make the best possible use of your time -- and, of course, feel free to plan on continuing your session on the interactive spaces!"
        audience_limit: "As you have chosen the 'Hands On' session type, we would like to know how many people can be part of your session. Also, for that kind of session, it might be interesting to add to your experience on the previous tries of this session and how many people attended."
        title: "Your session title is the most visible information in your submission. The primal and main display for both Reviewers and Attendees. It should be short, consistent with the presentation and preferably instigating. Unfortunately, many attendees don't read summaries and you'll be competing with many other sessions for people's attention. Be creative, but not so much that the connection to the topic is lost."
        tag_list: "Attendees will use this information on the schedule app to find sessions that interests them most, orthogonally to tracks. Choose wisely up to 10 tags in order to help your targeted audience find your session. A good match between right attendees and the right session turns into good feedback. This field isn't used for reviewing."
        second_author_username: "Except for 'Duels', which always have 2 speakers, a session can have one or two authors. The second author also needs a speaker-enabled profile, and you can come back later to fill that information until submissions deadline. Authors are considered equals: there is no special treatment for 1st and 2nd authors in evaluation. Also, please notice that \"presentations\" (25') can be presented in pairs but get only one complimentary registration."
        target_audience: "Exactly who is your public? Briefly describe who you would like to be your targeted audience, who is it intended for? For example: developers, analysts, architects, project managers, executives, etc. This field is used only by reviewers, to assess content consistence, and by track leaders, to create a balanced schedule for diverse attendees."
        prerequisites: "What previous knowledge people should have in order to be part of and take advantage of your session? With this year's shorter sessions, it is particularly important to put some work on this field. It is used by reviewers to assess consistence among content, level and duration. It will also be visible in session details on the schedule app and on door posters."
        summary: "The summary prime importance is to bring attendees in. Second to the title, attendees will look at your session summary to understand if they want to watch it. Thus, it needs to be strong and highlight differentials your session brings to the targeted audience. Reviewers will read your summary and, right below, we will also read your full description (therefore there is no need to repeat information) in order to check if they make sense."
        description: "This field is <b>not visible</b> to attendees! However, it is the main field for reviewers: it puts all other informations in context and allows us to assess the proposal's cohesion. Write about your motivations, what you intend on discussing, your perspective on the subject, etc. If you have slides, post the link. Add anything that will show how your session is the right one for the conference and, please, don't repeat your summary: we will read both."
        mechanics: 'You can always fill this field, if you like. Mechanics is only mandatory for "Hands On" and "Be Creative!" sessions. In it you must tell us how you want to interact with the public during the session, what techniques you will be using, how you plan to split your time slot and room layout required. This field is also not visible to participants.'
        benefits: "List the benefits your attendees will take home. What will they learn? What will they experience? What are their takeaways? Make it clear why the session will add to the public and be specific. This is not visible for attendees. Don't make up stuff, just be honest and highlight your session's best features. Also, don't be vague. Phrases such as 'understand Agile better' lack the details we need for assessment."
        experience: "We are not looking for a particular kind of credentials, but rather the motives you believe your circumstances, story, knowledge, past presentations, research fronts, or inspirations qualify you. This field is not about your resumé: we will assess your mini-bio separately! This field is about <b>this proposal, specifically</b>. Attendees won't see this information. And remember: if you have a 2nd author, mention both here."
