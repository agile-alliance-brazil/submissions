Hello, #{@session.authors.map(&:full_name).join(" & ")}!


We have good and bad news regarding your session proposal '#{h(@session.title)}' submitted to #{@conference_name}.


Bad news is that, up to this point, your session was not selected to compose this year's program. We received a large number of submissions, and it was very challenging to select the proposals that are going to compose our schedule during the days of the conference.


But, the good news is that your session was highly evaluated and is listed as one of our backup sessions, so it can be still selected! :)


Stay tuned and keep your hopes up: if a selected author withdraws his/her session, then backup proposals will be called immediately. If your session becomes part of our selected list, #{@conference_name}'s organizing committee will reach out to you.


Please check the feedback reviewers provided specifically for your session here:

= session_reviews_url(@conference, @session, type: :final, locale: 'en')


Should you have any questions, requests or comments, do not hesitate in contacting the Program Committee at programa@agilebrazil.com.


We hope to have even better news soon and, regardless, we hope to see you at the conference, this year!


Our best regards,


#{"--"}
