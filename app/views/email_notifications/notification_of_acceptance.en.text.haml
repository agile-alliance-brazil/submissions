Dear #{@session.authors.map(&:full_name).join(" & ")},


We are pleased to inform you that your proposal '#{h(@session.title)}' has been selected to be part of the program of the Brazilian Conference about Agile Methods – #{@conference_name}!


We would like to ask you to confirm your attendance at the event until #{Ability::AUTHOR_CONFIRMATION_DEADLINE.strftime('%H:%M of %B %dth, %Y')} by accessing the form at

= session_confirm_url(@session, :locale => 'en')


If you can not attend the event, we kindly ask you to confirm your withdrawal using the form at

= session_withdraw_url(@session, :locale => 'en')


- if(@session.authors.size > 1)
  Any of the two authors (#{@session.author.full_name} or #{@session.second_author.full_name}) may confirm or withdraw the attendance. Once the attendance is confirmed or withdrawn by any author, none can change the decision.


The sessions whose authors do not confirm or withdraw their attendance until #{Ability::AUTHOR_CONFIRMATION_DEADLINE.strftime('%B %dth, %Y')} will be automatically removed from the program and replaced immediately by other selected work.


After the attendance or withdrawal has been confirmed for the event, you can refer to the comments and suggestions made by the evaluators accessing:

= session_reviews_url(@session, :locale => 'en')


If your attendance is confirmed, the organization of #{@conference_name} will contact you about your complementary registration#{@session.authors.size > 1 ? 's' : ''} for the event.


Should you have any queries, requests or comments, please contact the Program Committee at programa@agilebrazil.com.


We hope to see you soon!
